# The 1.16.5 Branch
### ...is all about the MC version it is named after.

1.16.5 does not support the technologies that this mod will rely on, so the 1.16.4 branch is like a pre-alpha of sorts. When 1.17 forge comes out, I will start with porting the current work over. Things like the increased hight limit and cave biomes will be nessecary for the first __**full**__ release of the mod.
