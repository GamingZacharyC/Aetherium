# Enchantment Descriptions
Adding enchantment descriptions is easy. Just make sure to include both keys: `enchantment.aetherium.NAME_REG.desc` (Enchantment Descriptions) and `enchantment.aetherium.NAME_REG.description` (JEI Enchantment Info). The Enchantent Description key should be a short description, while the JEI Enchantment Info key should be longer and more detailed, with things like leveled lists.

An example, included before the enchantment was even added, is Warding. The descriptions can be found under `enchantment.aetherium.warding.description` & `enchantment.aetherium.warding.desc`.
